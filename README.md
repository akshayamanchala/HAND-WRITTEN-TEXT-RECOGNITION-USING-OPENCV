# Handwritten Text Recognition Using OpenCV and Tesseract

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten text using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR. It processes images of handwritten text and converts them into machine-readable text. The primary objective is to automate the extraction of handwritten content from scanned documents, notes, and images.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Image Preprocessing**: Noise removal, thresholding, and contour detection using OpenCV.
2. **Character Segmentation**: Identifying and isolating individual characters or words.
3. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Using Tesseract OCR to extract text from processed images.
4. **Post-processing**: Cleaning and refining the extracted text for improved readability and accuracy.
